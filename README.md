# Machine Learning Self-Study  

## About This Repository  
This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning and mastering Machine Learning concepts through hands-on projects and structured tutorials. Each project has its own folder, containing code, explanations, and insights gained from various learning resources such as GeeksforGeeks and other educational platforms.  

## Learning Approach  
- **Structured Learning**: Following tutorials, courses, and research papers to build a solid foundation.  
- **Project-Based Exploration**: Implementing ML algorithms and real-world use cases to reinforce concepts.  
- **Documentation & Reflection**: Writing detailed notes and explanations to track progress and understanding.  

## Repository Structure  
- **ðŸ“‚ Project Folders**: Each folder contains a specific ML project, including datasets, notebooks, and reports.  
- **ðŸ“„ Main README**: Overview of my learning progress and key takeaways.  

## Projects  
Here are the projects I have worked on so far:  

1. **[Project Name 1](./Health_Care/)** - Brief description of the project.  


*(More projects will be added as I progress! ðŸš€)*  

## Goals  
- Develop a strong understanding of fundamental and advanced ML techniques.  
- Gain practical experience by working on diverse ML projects.  
- Improve coding, model-building, and data analysis skills.
